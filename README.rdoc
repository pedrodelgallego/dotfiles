= Pedro Del Gallego Dot Files

I tried my best to keep my box the way I like it. 


== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/pedrodelgallego/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install


== Environment

I am running on Ubuntu/Linux 10.04, but it will likely work on Linux Distribution or Mac OS X as well with minor modifications. 

To switch to zsh you can use the next command:

  chsh -s /bin/zsh

== Features

Comming Soon.
